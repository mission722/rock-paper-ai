# Rock Paper Scissors AI - Predict and Counter

Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissors AI** project! This game features an intelligent AI that not only plays random moves but also learns from the user’s actions and predicts future moves. The key to winning against this AI is to be unpredictable. 

## Features

- **Random Moves**: For the first 6 turns, the AI plays random moves.
- **User Move Tracking**: From the 6th turn onward, the AI starts predicting the user's moves.
- **Pattern Recognition**: The AI detects patterns in the user’s moves and predicts the next move.
- **Counter Attack**: If a pattern is detected, the AI counteracts the user's predicted move, making it harder to win.
- **Unpredictable Strategy**: If no pattern is detected, the AI continues to play randomly until a pattern emerges.
- **Challenge**: The only way to win consistently is to be unpredictable. If you play in a predictable pattern, the AI will learn and counteract your moves.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the game visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic, move prediction, and user interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Phase (First 6 Moves)**: The AI plays completely random moves without any influence from the user.
2. **Tracking and Prediction**: After the 6th move, the AI begins recording the user’s moves and looks for any patterns.
3. **Countering User Moves**: Once a pattern is detected, the AI predicts the user’s next move and counters it accordingly.
4. **Random Strategy**: If no pattern is found, the AI will continue playing randomly, but once a pattern appears, the AI will use that to gain an advantage.

## How to Play

1. Click on the game buttons to choose your move: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
2. The AI will respond with its move.
3. Watch as the AI learns and adapts to your gameplay.
4. Try to keep your moves unpredictable to avoid being countered!
